# Test Platform
1. Tests all the other CloudFormation stacks in the [samples](../)
1. Creates a Lambda function that is AUTOMATICALLY run once a day which creates all the CloudFormation stacks

# !WARNING!
When this pipeline is created (by following all of the directions below), AWS resources will be created once a day due to the automatic Lambda function. If you do not want resources to be made daily, make sure to delete all of these resources when you're finished. At the very least, go into AWS Lambda, look for the function that matches your Cloudformation stack names, and delete the Lambda function, which will stop the pipeline from running every day.

# Setup

The following is typically configured one time per AWS account. The following examples assume AWS region `us-east-1`

1. Create a *Secure String* parameter named `GitHubToken` in [Parameter Store](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Parameters:)
1. Modify the [buildspec-cfnstacks.yml](./buildspec-cfnstacks.yml) to obtain the values of the parameters you defined in Parameter Store

# Launch Stack

[![Launch CFN stack](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.devopsessentialsaws.com/img/deploy-to-aws.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#cstack=sn%7Edevops-essentials-test-platform%7Cturl%7Ehttps://s3.amazonaws.com/www.devopsessentialsaws.com/samples/test-platform/pipeline.yml)

# Configure Solution

1. Once the CloudFormation stack is successful, select the checkbox next to the stack and click the <strong>Outputs</strong> tab. 
1. From Outputs, click on the **PipelineUrl** output. The Source action will be in a failed state.
1. From the CodePipeline Source action, click on the CodeCommit provider and copy the **git clone** statement provided by CodeCommit
1. Paste the command in your Terminal
1. From this [samples/test-platform](../test-platform) folder, copy the **[buildspec-cfnstacks.yml](./buildspec-cfnstacks.yml)** file to your locally cloned CodeCommit git repo
1. From this [samples/test-platform](../test-platform) folder, copy the **[buildspec-lambda.yml](./buildspec-lambda.yml)** file to your locally cloned CodeCommit git repo
1. From this [samples/test-platform](../test-platform) folder, copy the **[sam-template.yml](./sam-template.yml)** file to your locally cloned CodeCommit git repo
1. From this [samples/test-platform](../test-platform) folder, copy the **[index.js](./index.js)** file to your locally cloned CodeCommit git repo
1. Open your local **[index.js](./index.js)** file and change the variable CHANGE_TO_CODEPIPELINE_NAME to match the name of your CodePipeline pipeline. (The name can be found by going to AWS CodePipeline in the AWS Console.)
1. From your Terminal, type `git add .`
1. From your Terminal, type `git commit -am "add new files"`
1. From your Terminal, type `git push`
1. Go back to your pipeline in CodePipeline and see the changes flow through the pipeline
1. Once the pipeline is complete, go to your CloudFormation stacks to see the CloudFormation stacks being generated

# Resources

1. The CloudFormation template is available [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.devopsessentialsaws.com/samples/test-platform/pipeline.yml).




# STATUS CHECKER IN DEVELOPMENT - Automation not yet implemented
Checks the status of cfn stacks, whether they have been created successfully, failed, or are 'in progress'.

To manually run:

First install boto3
1. `pip install boto3`
1. IF you are on a mac and run into an error while trying to install boto3
1. Try this command instead:
1. `sudo pip install --ignore-installed six boto3`

After boto3 is installed:
1. Open status-checker.py
1. Change the string inside the first function, get_stacks_to_be_tested(), to the name or part of the name of the cfn stack(s) you want to check. It's currently ForThePeople
1. From command line, run:
1. `python status-checker.py`
1. This will create a file called cfn-stack-results.md
1. Open cfn-stack-results.md to view results
